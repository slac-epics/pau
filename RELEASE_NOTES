Release Notes for the PAU package
---------------------------------
pau-R1-4-2-11: Re-build against:
                (support R3-14-12)
		seq-R2-0-11-lcls4
		event-R3-2-2-br_generaltime-1-3
		udpComm-R2-1-5
		miscUtils-R2-2-2
		fcom-R1-3-7
		fcomUtil-R1-1-6


pau-R1-4-2-10: To support new Laser LLRF
		Re-build against:
                      event-R3-2-1-br_backprop-2-1
                      udpComm-R2-1-6
                      fcom-R1-3-8
                      fcomUtil-R1-1-7

pau-R1-4-2-5: Add new API for LLRF
	              int setDataToFcomDataSlot_DSn(mux_ts *pMux, double data, unsigned slot)
              This API is required to update all FCOM data slots every time.
              We need this API only for the LLRF software.

pau-R1-4-2-4: PAU data structure change for the LLRF application
              We need to clean up the Pockels Cell permit from PAU pattern, to get update FCOM data slot
              everytime event there is beam or not.
              We need to step down the Pockels Cell permit check into the usrPush function, this function requires
              the advanced pattern (the evr modifier) to check up the permit.

pau-R1-4-2-3: Build with fcom-R1-3-2-3, fcomUtil-R1-1-1-3, and event-R3-2-1-br_backprop-2-0

pau-R1-4-2-2: Build with fcom-R1-3-2-2, and fcomUtil-R1-1-1-2

pau-R1-4-2-1: derived from the "pau-R1-4-2-BR" branch.  This was necessary due to dependencies
              on udpComm. Did not want to build agaist the new udpComm as the API has changed.
              This will be done later.

pau-R1-4-2: Feb 4, 2011 (KHKIM)
    Fixing a bug on the backward propation (it only work when DS0 updated)    

pau-R1-4-1: Dec 14, 2010 (KHKIM)
    Add up a new MACRO variable for sncPauFcomPush, if MUX has different name with the FCOM
    ex) if MUX has same name with the FCOM
        seq(&sncPauFcomPush, "MUX_NAME=<mux name>")
        if MUX has different name with FCOM
        seq(&sncPauFcomPush, "MUX_NAME=<mux name>, FCOM_NAME=<fcom name>")

pau-R1-4-0: Dec 14, 2010 (KHKIM)
    To support fcomUtil-R1-1-1

pau-R1-3-0: Dec 14, 2010 (KHKIM)
    To avoid glitch when turn on the feedback mode
        - add up new SNL program: sncPauFcomPush
          . keep update fcomBlob with the static data slot during the feedback turned off
        - add up user callback for the feedback turn on/off
          . if the callback function pointer has non-NULL value, the device support will execute the callback function
          . we don't need it right now, but in a future we can use it if we need

pau-R1-2-0: Nov 3, 2010 (KHKIM)
    To support fcomUtil-R1-1-0

pau-R1-1-1: Aug 31, 2010 (KHKIM)
    Bug fix in init state in the iocAdmin state set in the sncPau.

pau-R1-1-0: Auguest 30, 2010 (KHKIM)
    Make relation with iocAdmin PV for the fast feedback on/off

pau-R0-1-9: Auguest 23, 2010 (KHKIM)
    Define the transient behavior between fast feedback ON and OFF
    ON: update fcom data slot from latest static data slot
    The mutex protection for the data slots
    Implement the backward propagation for master MUX PV
 

pau-R0-1-8: Auguest 22, 2010 (KHKIM)
    Bug fix in PulseID matching function for the interlaced mode

pau-R0-1-7: Auguest 12, 2010 (KHKIM)
    Just re-build with the new fcomUtil (R1-0-0).

pau-R0-1-6: July 30, 2010 (KHKIM)
    Add up FCOM pulse ID matching for current pattern matching
    Please, find the description of the following APIs in the README file
	int pauVerifyPulseIdFcomBlob(FcomBlob *pBlob, mux_ts *pMux)
	int makeFcomPVNamewithSlotNumber(const char *muxName, const char *fcomPVNAme, int slot_number)

pau-R0-1-5: Jun 2, 2010  (dfairley)
	change to build with event-R3-2-1
pau-R0-1-4: Apr 28, 2010  (KHKIM)
    Change to allow save/restore for BO and AO records
pau-R0-1-3: Apr 25, 2010  (KHKIM)
    Put PINI field to allow the restore function
    Implement force update when offset get new values

pau-R0-1-2: Mar 22, 2010
    upgrade to base-R3-14-8-2-lcls6 (DROGIND)
pau-R0-1-1: Mar 12, 2010
